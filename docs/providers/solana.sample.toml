# Sample Solana Provider Configuration
#
# Solana providers connect to Solana RPC endpoints for blockchain data extraction.
# This provider uses Old Faithful ONE CAR files for historical archive data
# and the Solana RPC endpoint for recent blocks.

# Provider type - must be "solana" for Solana providers
kind = "solana"

# Blockchain network identifier (e.g., "solana-mainnet")
network = "solana-mainnet"

# Solana RPC endpoint URL
rpc_provider_url = "${SOLANA_RPC_URL}"

# Directory for storing Old Faithful ONE CAR files
# This directory is used to cache downloaded archive data
of1_car_directory = "/data/solana/car"

# ============================
# Optional Fields
# ============================

# Controls when to use the Solana archive for historical data (optional)
# - "auto": Automatically determine based on block age
# - "always": Always use the archive, even for recent blocks
# - "never": Never use the archive, fetch all blocks from the RPC provider
# Default: "always"
# use_archive = "always"

# Rate limit for RPC calls per second (optional)
# When set, limits the number of RPC calls to avoid rate limiting
# Default: no rate limit
# max_rpc_calls_per_second = 10

# Whether to keep downloaded CAR files after processing (optional)
# - true: Retain CAR files on disk after extraction
# - false: Delete CAR files after processing to save disk space
# Default: false
# keep_of1_car_files = false
