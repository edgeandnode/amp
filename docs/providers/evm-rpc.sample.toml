# Sample EVM RPC Provider Configuration
#
# EVM RPC providers connect to Ethereum-compatible JSON-RPC endpoints for extracting blockchain data.
# This provider type supports IPC, WebSocket, and HTTP/HTTPS connections.

# Provider type - must be "evm-rpc" for EVM RPC providers
kind = "evm-rpc"

# Blockchain network identifier (e.g., "mainnet", "goerli", "polygon", "base")
network = "mainnet"

# RPC endpoint URL. Supported schemes:
# - http:// or https:// for HTTP connections
# - ws:// or wss:// for WebSocket connections
# - ipc:// for IPC socket connections
url = "${RPC_ETH_MAINNET_URL}"

# Maximum number of concurrent requests to the RPC endpoint (optional)
# Default: 1024
# concurrent_request_limit = 1024

# Maximum number of JSON-RPC requests to batch together in a single call (optional)
# Set to 0 to disable batching
# Default: 0 (no batching)
# rpc_batch_size = 0

# Rate limit in requests per minute (optional)
# When set, limits the number of requests made to the RPC endpoint to avoid rate limiting
# Default: no rate limit
# rate_limit_per_minute = 600

# Whether to fetch transaction receipts individually or in bulk (optional)
# - true: Use eth_getTransactionReceipt for each transaction (slower, more compatible)
# - false: Use eth_getBlockReceipts to fetch all receipts for a block at once (faster, requires support)
# Default: false
# fetch_receipts_per_tx = false
