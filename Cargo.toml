# Prost fork
#
# The only change in our fork is to bump the recursion limit from 100 to 1000, to allow deserializing
# larger queries serialized with datafusion-proto. This is preferable to using the
# `no-recursion-limit` feature, for two reasons:
# 1. It's more secure, as it still prevents stack overflow attacks, just with a larger limit.
# 2. `no-recursion-limit` did not work, in our testing it work on macos but not on linux.
#
# Something like https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost/pull/785 would enable us to remove this fork.
