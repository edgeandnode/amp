# Amp

Amp turns your smart contracts into SQL-queryable datasets automatically.

Deploy a contract, emit events, and instantly query them with SQL. No backend, no indexers, no configuration.

Build real-time dashboards, analytics tools, and data-driven applications using the language you already know: SQL.
