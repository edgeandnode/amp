# semi-formal models

This directory contains [semi-formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods#Semi-formal_methods)
models for verification of Nozzle behavior. These models are written using the [Quint](https://quint-lang.org/)
specification language, which is similar to TLA+ with Apalache.

## integration TODO
- remove diff from insert output
- remove compaction code for now
- improve tests to check spec properties
- fix determinism issues in canonical chain selection
