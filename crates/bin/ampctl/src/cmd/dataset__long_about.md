Manage datasets in the Amp system.

Datasets are registered blockchain data sources with defined schemas, transformations,
and storage configurations. Use these commands to inspect, list, and manage dataset
registrations and versions in the content-addressable manifest store.

The dataset subcommands provide full lifecycle management including version control,
manifest inspection, and cleanup operations.
