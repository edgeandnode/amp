# Sample Firehose Provider Configuration
#
# Firehose providers connect to StreamingFast Firehose gRPC endpoints for high-throughput
# blockchain data streaming. Firehose provides real-time blockchain data with high performance
# and reliability.

# Provider type - must be "firehose" for Firehose providers
kind = "firehose"

# Blockchain network identifier (e.g., "mainnet", "goerli", "polygon", "base")
network = "mainnet"

# Firehose gRPC endpoint URL
url = "${FIREHOSE_ETH_MAINNET_URL}"

# Authentication token for the Firehose endpoint (optional)
# Required if your Firehose endpoint requires authentication
# Default: no authentication
token = "${FIREHOSE_ETH_MAINNET_TOKEN}"
