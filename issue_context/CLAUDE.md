# Writing good issue context
- These are a historical log of the plan taken by the LLM to solve an issue.
- Be high level, don't describe code details, but the initial objective, a very concise description of how it was
  fixed, and considerations relevant for future work.
- Be precise, avoid vague wording such as "successfully", "correctly", "limitations", "comprehensive"
