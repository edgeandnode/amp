### Welcome to Amp Docs

Amp is Edge & Node’s scalable blockchain database that makes blockchain data usable, verifiable, and enterprise-ready. It converts complex onchain data into structured, queryable insights through SQL-based indexing and analytics—removing latency and manual overhead common in legacy ETL systems.

Amp provides a secure, compliant platform where teams can extract, transform, and query blockchain data entirely in SQL. Using the Amp CLI and Local Studio, developers can rapidly prototype, deploy, and scale blockchain data products without managing backend infrastructure.

## Why Amp?

- Traditional database systems aren’t designed to scale and are slow, and inflexible.
- Many databases have been around for 30 years and were designed to be general-purpose and not for blockchain transactions.
- No native support for AI or blockchain interoperability. Many systems are cobbled together off-the-shelf solutions.

### Amp addresses these gaps with:

- **SQL-native querying** — Simplifies blockchain data access and transformation.
- **Verifiable indexing** — Every record maintains an auditable link to its onchain origin.
- **Scalable architecture** — Handles enterprise workloads, high-volume indexing, and real-time analytics.

## Who is Amp for?

Amp is built for data-driven teams that rely on high-quality, production-ready blockchain data.
