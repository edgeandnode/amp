# Sample Ethereum Beacon Provider Configuration
#
# Ethereum Beacon providers connect to Ethereum consensus layer (Beacon Chain) nodes for
# extracting consensus layer data such as beacon blocks, attestations, and validator information.

# Provider type - must be "eth-beacon" for Ethereum Beacon providers
kind = "eth-beacon"

# Blockchain network identifier for the consensus layer (e.g., "mainnet-beacon", "goerli-beacon")
# Note: Use "-beacon" suffix to distinguish from execution layer networks
network = "mainnet-beacon"

# Beacon node API endpoint URL
# Should point to a Beacon Chain REST API endpoint
url = "${BEACON_ETH_MAINNET_URL}"

# Maximum number of concurrent requests to the Beacon API endpoint (optional)
# Default: 1024
# concurrent_request_limit = 1024

# Rate limit in requests per minute (optional)
# When set, limits the number of requests made to the Beacon API to avoid rate limiting
# Default: no rate limit
# rate_limit_per_minute = 600
